/**
 * Controller input for up to eight players, as a singleton.
 *
 * Supported controllers: DualShock 2 and other PS2 pads on both controller
 * ports, up to four per port through a multitap, and DualShock 3/4 over USB
 * (two) or Bluetooth (two, with a USB Bluetooth adapter).
 *
 * Only the two controller ports work out of the box. Multitap, USB and
 * Bluetooth each need an IOP driver that costs IOP memory, so they start
 * disabled; turn on the ones the program uses, preferably before the first
 * `update()`:
 * ```js
 * Gamepad.configure({ multitap: true, usb: true });
 * ```
 *
 * Players are logical: a controller that connects takes the lowest free
 * player and keeps it until it disconnects, whatever port or cable it uses.
 * Controllers already plugged in at start-up are assigned about half a
 * second after the first `update()`, in this order: port 1 slots A-D, port 2
 * slots A-D, USB, Bluetooth. Without multitaps, the pads on port 1 and port 2
 * therefore become players 0 and 1.
 *
 * Call `Gamepad.update()` once per frame. It polls every controller and
 * freezes a snapshot, so everything read from a `Player` during the frame is
 * cheap and consistent. `Gamepad.player(i)` always returns the same object.
 *
 * Analog values are normalized: sticks in [-1, 1], pressure and rumble
 * strength in [0, 1].
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const p1 = Gamepad.player(0);
 *
 * while (true) {
 *     Gamepad.update();
 *     if (p1.justDisconnected) pause();
 *     if (p1.justPressed(Gamepad.CROSS)) jump();
 *     const move = p1.leftStick();
 *     x += move.x * speed;
 *     if (hit) p1.rumble(0.8, 0, 200);
 *     Screen.flip();
 * }
 * ```
